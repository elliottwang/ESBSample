Role
We are looking for a summer software engineering intern to develop J2EE components, work on feature enhancements, and do code refactoring for a multi-petabyte, multi-million user business intelligence application.
The intern will be an important part of our small but incredible R&D team, which is currently made up of about 15 Masters and PhD computer scientists from around the world, and will actually get to see his or her work implemented in our product. Our intern must therefore be both talented and driven to deliver excellent work, and must know how to think critically about design before coding.
This is a great opportunity for someone who wants to get exposure to software development and deployment in an enterprise environment and, because our team is growing, there is the possibility of full-time employment after graduation.
Requirements
J2EE (prior experience either in school or in a past internship is required)
Java
SQL
Strong understanding of computer science fundamentals and software engineering principles
Thanks and good luck!
